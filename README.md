# Brevity Application



First of all, you need to install NPM in your PC.

Then, enter the main folder `/brevity` and use the command line : 
```shell
npm start
```

Go to `login.html` under `/brevity/app` and open it with a browser.   
For now, any login is accepted; when clicking 'login' button, you should access to the app.
